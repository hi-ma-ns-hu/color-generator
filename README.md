This is a color-generator application which is created using React.

In the input field, users can put their favorite color name either in rgb or hex format and the application will generate 201 different shades of the color including the color entered by the user. They can also enter the color name for e.g. red.

Users can also copy their favourite shade to their clipboard by clicking on it and then can use it anywhere they like.
